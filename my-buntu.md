Ubuntu is one of the most popular and one of the best Linux distributions.
I am not a fan of Gnome. In my opinion it is too heavy. 

I tried to build my own custom and lightweight ubuntu ISO. I started with customizing Xubuntu and Kubuntu ISO images and ended with Live Build scripts running in debian docker that are able to build my custom my-buntu images with XFCE or KDE. Both editions have Openbox, i3wm and DWM window managers.
