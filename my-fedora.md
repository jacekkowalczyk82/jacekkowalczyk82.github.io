Fedora is one of the most popular and one of the best Linux distributions.  
I have never bean a fan of the Fedora with Gnome. In my opinion it is too heavy. 
I wanted to try Fedora but without this too many resource consuming Gnome. 
There are official [Fedora Spins](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/) but I wanted to have something more lighweight :-) 

I tried to build my own light Fedora ISO. I created build scripts and configurations for my custom Fedora editions XFCE + DWM, KDE + DWM, DWM ultra light, MATE + DWM.
