 **DRAFT**
 
Many times I was watching youube films and reading web articles titled: Top 5 /10 Linux Distributions, or what is the best Linux Distribution. 
After spending many hours on installing them to VirtualBox machines (some to real hardware), testing, using, customising, building my own custom ISO images, Now I can say and write what I think about it and and what are my Top Operating Systems. 
I use term Operating System as I will not touch only Linux Distributions but also BSD systems. I will write here a bit also about Desktop Environments and Window Managers. 

**What is important for me?** 

* Stability
* Stability
* Stability
* How easy to maintain


## This is my top 5 list that I can recommend

but I will not order it because some one them are god for beginners and some only for experts. 

### FreeBSD, GhostBSD, FuryBSD 

* It is stablle OS but not easy for beginers. Recenly I updated my Lenovo ThinkPad x240 to FreeBSD 12.1 Release and I must say it was very very easy. 

* Debian (XFCE, KDE, Mate, DWM, Openbox, i3)

* MX Linux 

* Ubuntu and Linux Mint Family (XFCE, Mate)

* Fedora (XFCE, MATE, DWM)

**Why I do not recommend rolling distributions like Arch or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed?**

* unstable 
* unstable 
* unstable 

**My Favourite Desktop Environments and Window Managers**

* XFCE
* KDE
* DWM
* Openbox
* i3wm


I do not recommend Gnome as it consumes too much resources and causes system not responsive. I know, latest versions of Gnome are much more responsive than it was few months ago but still are not as fast and light as XFCE.
