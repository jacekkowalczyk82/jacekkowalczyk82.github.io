If you think Arch Linux is hard to install, I may agree but there is planty of documentation and manuals.

I started playing around with Arch Linux in May 2018. It was not easy to create the custom Arch Linux ISO image that time but right now, maybe I am bit smarter because I did it. 

Detailed documentation and config files can be found at bitbucket.org in [my-arch project](https://bitbucket.org/jacek_kowalczyk/my-arch/src/master/), that I created. 
Project covers installation of ArchLinux, basic customization of i3wm and manual how to generate Livecd ISO image. 
The project is live and the documentation is still updated.
