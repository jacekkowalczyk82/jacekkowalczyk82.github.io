If you think Arch Linux is hard to install, I may agree but there is planty of documentation and manuals. 

I started playing around with Arch Linux in May 2018. It was not easy to create the custom Arch Linux ISO image that time but right now maybe I ma bit smarter and I did it. 

At bitbucket.org there is [my-arch project](https://bitbucket.org/jacek_kowalczyk/my-arch/src/master/) I created. You can find there manual of how to install it, how to customize it and generate Livecd ISO image. 
The project is live and the documentation is still updated.
