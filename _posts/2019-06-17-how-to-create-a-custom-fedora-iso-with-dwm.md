Fedora is one of the most popular and one of the best Linux distributions.  
I have never bean a fan of the Fedora with Gnome. In my opinion it is too heavy. 
I wanted to try Fedora but without this too many resource consuming Gnome. 
There are official [Fedora Spins](https://spins.fedoraproject.org/) but I wanted to have something more lighweight :-) 

I tried to build my own light Fedora ISO. 

In this repository [fedora-dwm-custom](https://github.com/jacekkowalczyk82/fedora-dwm-custom) you can find build scripts and mu configurations for my Fedora editions (XFCE + DWM, KDE + DWM, DWM ultra light).
