It is a loong time since I posted here...

Recently I discovered a nice library from apache, which allows to create PPTX presentations from java code. 

So ....I created a new project on GitHub: https://github.com/jacekkowalczyk82/code-2-present

I hope, soon I will write some update post about this.
